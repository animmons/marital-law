			At the Law Office of Benjamin T. Hodas, LLC, we offer elite and professional family law services for high-profile clients in West Palm Beach, Florida, and the surrounding metropolitan area. Our focus is on high-asset divorce and related legal mtters that involve asset protection, business valuation, Florida property division and more.
